# FlowMeter_ATTiny85
Flow rate sensor connected to ATTiny85
Using the flow rate sensor with ATTiny85 - have to put a max rate to detect the flow of water and give out this signal to the main processor (ESP32).
Use Sleep mode in ATTiny85 to conserve power. 
One advantage is that the signals from the flow rate sensor can be 5V for ATTiny85
